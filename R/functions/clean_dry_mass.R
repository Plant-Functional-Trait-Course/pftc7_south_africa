# relevant remarks from dm
# species ID -> Imke
# CYZ2241 "not able to ID species"-> Name can be changed to Helichrysum pilosellum (old Helichrysum naming system), or Helichrysum nudifolium (New Helichrysum naming system). -> check!!!

# DCI2655 "Check scan this is Lotononis Lotonoides whi.." -> Species trifoliolate. Four leaflets were scanned, meaning that 1.33 leaves were scanned. The bulk number was changed accordingly. I think this is a bit dodgy so maybe this scan can be disregarded.
# JDQ3343 "Please check as this ID was not found on th.." !!!!

# DZC6492 Enter as is - species ID was incorrect and original material was -> Cannot find this scan on OSF. !!!

# DDF1749 =Pimpernella caffra -> The name is changed to Pimpinella caffra during the name cleaning. Comment can be ignored
!!!

# error with leaf -> check when checking stipules etc.
# ISD4620 Stipules cut off; do include -> check scan
# EHK0364 Stipules missing
# DTW0238 petiole missing
# HZE2519 Missing stipules
# HYX7739 Missing stipules
# DCO3139 Incorrectly processed; no leaflets
# HUW9936 3 leaflets have fallen off
# HZE2519 Missing stipules

# mass
# CST7009 dry mass more than wet mass -> envelope checked -> check visual !!!
# AOT1171 "Please check Envelope was marked as enteredâ€¦" -> ok, is RangeX plant

# check scans - scans checked ok
# HFG6252 1 leaf does not look good -> looks ok
# HZJ5499 Immature leaves -> tiny but ok
# IKD3755 1 membrane seperated from its leaf -> ok
# AMM3671 Leaves dried onto envelope, may effect weight -> ok
# ARC2558 Some leaf matter may have dried to paper -> ok
# CZL2897 was not scanned- no leaf area
# IEU4695 Only one sketchy leaf -> needs remark damaged - done
